yaml2html
=========

This tool is NOT that much about YAML nor HTML. Those just happen to be the
easiest targets I could think of for examining elegant methods for verification
and manipulation of arbitrary data structures formed out of well defined parts.
Over the last fifteen years I have often wanted to automate solutions to
different problems with a compact set of such methods.

Forming HTML documents out of such data structures according to rules expressed
in same way may be a good goal as I actually want to find out a combination of
necessary methods not totally unlike but almost infinitely easier to use than,
say, XSLT.
